# Code Function Description
This document provides a detailed description of each function in the Flask and Dash application for amplitude analysis of audio files.
## 1. Flask Initialization and Routes
`server = Flask(__name__)`

- **Purpose:** Initializes the Flask server.
- **Description:** This statement creates an instance of the Flask application, which will be used to handle HTTP requests and manage the routing of the application.
  
`@server.route('/')`
- **Purpose:** Defines the route for the home page.
- **Description:** This route renders the home page of the application by returning the index.html template when the root URL (/) is accessed.

`@server.route('/analyse.html')`
- **Purpose:** Defines the route for the analysis page.
- **Description:** This route renders the Dash application when the /analyse.html URL is accessed, integrating the Dash application into the Flask framework.
## 2. Dash Initialization and Layout
`app = Dash(__name__, server=server, url_base_pathname='/analyse/')`
- **Purpose:** Initializes the Dash application.
- **Description:** This creates an instance of the Dash application and links it to the Flask server, setting the base URL path for the Dash app to `/analyse/`.

`app.layout`
- **Purpose:** Defines the layout of the Dash application. 
- **Description:** Specifies the structure and components of the Dash application, including:
  - An H1 header displaying "Amplitude Analysis".
A file upload component for uploading audio files.
A placeholder for the amplitude plot (dcc.Graph).
A container for displaying messages.
A placeholder for the FFT plot (dcc.Graph).
